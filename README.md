## Custom

I am also taking a stab at creating my own custom wordlist.

#### 📜 Rules for Inclusion

1. **Word Length**

   * No 1-letter words (2-letter words are the minimum).
   * No strict maximum length; long words are manually reviewed.

2. **Familiarity**

   * Words should be **fairly familiar** to most English speakers.
   * Some complex or unusual words are included intentionally for variety.

3. **Homophones & Plurals**

   * Homophones (e.g., `bare/bear`) and plural forms (e.g., `car/cars`) may or may not be included; this will evolve over time.

4. **No Slurs or Offensive Language**

   * Absolutely no slurs, offensive terms, or culturally sensitive content.

5. **Categories Included**

   * 🌍 Cities: `paris`, `london`, `toronto`
   * 🍕 Foods: `pizza`, `sushi`, `poutine`
   * 🐼 Animals: `panda`, `tiger`, `koala`
   * 🏺 Mythological Figures: `zeus`, `apollo`, `athena`
   * 🎸 Objects: `guitar`, `notebook`, `controller`
   * ⚡ Verbs & Actions: `jump`, `run`, `laugh`
   * …and more.

6. **Formatting**

   * All words are lowercase.
   * No punctuation, diacritics, or symbols.
   * One word per line

7. **Growth**

   * No fixed target size; the list will grow or shrink as needed.
