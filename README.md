## Custom

I am also taking a stab at creating my own custom wordlist.

#### 📜 Light Rules for Inclusion

1. **Word Length**

   * No 1-letter words (2-letter words are the minimum).
   * No strict maximum length; long words are manually reviewed.

2. **Familiarity**

   * Words should be **fairly familiar** to most English speakers.
   * Some complex or unusual words are included intentionally for variety.

3. **Homophones & Plurals**

   * Homophones (e.g., `bare/bear`) and plural forms (e.g., `car/cars`) may or may not be included; this will evolve over time.

4. **No Slurs or Offensive Language**

   * Absolutely no slurs, offensive terms, or culturally sensitive content.

5. **Categories Included**

   * 🌍 Cities: `paris`, `london`, `toronto`
   * 🍕 Foods: `pizza`, `sushi`, `poutine`
   * 🐼 Animals: `panda`, `tiger`, `koala`
   * 🏺 Mythological Figures: `zeus`, `apollo`, `athena`
   * 🎸 Objects: `guitar`, `notebook`, `controller`
   * ⚡ Verbs & Actions: `jump`, `run`, `laugh`
   * …and more.

6. **Formatting**

   * All words are lowercase.
   * No punctuation, diacritics, or symbols.
   * One word per line

7. **Growth**

   * No fixed target size; the list will grow or shrink as needed.

#### Why I like passphrases

Passphrases are just a bunch of words words— something like “waffle-radio-tiger-london.” They’re very secure when [generated randomly](https://20070816.xyz/passphrase), but can be memorized (although you should only memorize one, the passphrase you use for the master password for your password manager), and are easier to type than randomly generated passwords or secret keys. Because the words come from big wordlists and are picked at random, the end result is way stronger than a short and ramdom jumble of numbers, letters & symbols you’ll forget in 2 minutes. In short: passphrases give you big-time security with small-time stress.
